h1. Recover corrupted Eudora mailbox files on Mac OS X

Sometimes when Eudora crashes when downloading files some of the mailbox files get corrupted.

Here's an example of what this type of corruption looks like:

!images/corrupted_eudora_message.png!

This corruption often extends through many messages in a mailbox.

The Ruby program recover_mailbox.rb will make a backup of a corrupted Eudora mailbox file and then 
try to recreate an uncorrupted version of the mailbox.

After downloading the program you can run it as follows:

ruby recover_mailbox.rb <path_to_corrupted_eudora_mailbox>
