h1. Recover corrupted Eudora mailbox files on Mac OS X

Sometimes when Eudora crashes when downloading files some of the mailbox files get corrupted.

Here's an example of what this type of corruption looks like:

This corruption often extends through many messages in a mailbox.

The Ruby program recover_mailbox.rb will make a backup of a corrupted Eudora mailbox file and then 
try to recreate an uncorrupted version of the mailbox.

After downloading the program you can run it as follows:

<pre><code>
# cd to the directory where the corrupted Eudora mailbox files is located
path_to_ruby_executable path_to_recover_mailbox.rb corrupted_eudora_mailbox
</code></pre>

On Mac OS X the default system ruby is located here: /usr/bin/ruby

Example:

<pre><code>
[~]$ cd ~/Documents/Eudora\ Folder\ \(stephen\)/Mail\ Folder/
[Mail Folder]$ /usr/bin/ruby /Users/stephen/dev/ruby/src/lib/recover_corrupted_macosx_eudora_mailboxes/recover_mailbox.rb In
Making backup copy of In to ./In-backup.
Reading 6330 messages from original Eudora mailbox: In.
Writing into new Eudora mailbox: ./In-2.
Replacing original Eudora mailbox: In with: ./In-2.
A copy of the original Eudora mailbox: In is now named: ./In-backup.
</code></pre>
